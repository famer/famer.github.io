Probably most underestimated part in IT is networking due to introversion of the IT crowd what is improving hopefully.
Unfortunately it is a big blocker for the progress of the industry.

Below is list of companies and people with whom I have personal contacts or friend working there. 
May be I underestimated our connection and didn't add you to the list, [contact me](/contact) and we will fix that.
