The thing I don't like about computers: they really always were banding people to make things not in easy way but in proper way for them. In order to make information understandable to them.

Some things sill have to be adopted, as far as computers not there yet. Most of them related to understanding texts and extracting knowledge from textual data. It is still weak point of computers.

But many problems do not exist anymore or exists only because of habits. Those should be wiped out completely. Such things related to lack of standards on early stages.
Encoding, replacing spaces with dashes and etc. State of art is ready to not to have them, but people still make such steps in favour of PC because of a habit. 
So I'm asking you behave stupidly, ask more, claim more about things not working, and may be some day it will reach acceptable level.
