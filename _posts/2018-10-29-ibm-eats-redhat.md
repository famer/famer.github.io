title: IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT
---

Ok, it's time to write. I went today to the Red Hat site to get to OpenShift account and there it is, "Breaking news: IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT".

I worked for both 3 months for former and rest to full year for latter. Both times that was my decision to quit.
So IBM I really don't know what to say. In the area I worked([Brno](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q14960)) there were offices of both. But people in IBM, as I realized later, mostly dreamed about work in nearby Red Hat, because of the salary, because of the higher level of development, because of mostly no legacy things, because of the culture. Ok, most of them because of the salary.  

Whats the difference? Here is some info from the employee of the Red Hat(same location, I suppose): [Red Hat insider comment].

Some guys from Red Hat hope they would change IBM, I really hope so and they'll make world better.
